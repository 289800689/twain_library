DTWAIN Version changes

5.1.0.3
- Add DTWAIN_...Ex() functions that return a DTWAIN_ARRAY.  These functions are simpler versions of the DTWAIN 
  functions that accept LPDTWAIN_ARRAY as a parameter.  This makes it simpler for languages such as Python and
  others that have issues with pointer arguments.  Thus instead of having to do something like this:

      DTWAIN_SOURCE Source;
      DTWAIN_ARRAY Array;
      //...
      DTWAIN_EnumOrientations(Source, &Array)...

The call can now be this:

      DTWAIN_SOURCE Source;
      //...
      DTWAIN_ARRAY array = DTWAIN_EnumOrientations(Source);

Since DTWAIN_ARRAY is actually an integer (32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the program's bit-ness), the calling 
application can simply treat the DTWAIN_ARRAY as an integer type.

For functions that already have an Ex() at the end of the function name, an Ex2() version was created, for example,
     DTWAIN_EnumSupportedCapsEx2()
     
     
5.1.0.1
- Add all supported PDF page dimensions to twaininfo.txt.  This allows customization of the PDF creation with
  respect to the page sizing (you can add your own definitions).
- Update sources to output Visual C++ 2019 compilation messages.

5.1.0.0
- Update LibTiff to version 4.0.10
- Update LibPNG to version 1.6.37
- Now requires application to call DTWAIN_UseMultipleThreads if one DTWAIN session will be used across multiple threads.
- Speed up processing DTWAIN functions when using DTWAIN in a single thread.
